## Description
This is a small todo app where you can add todo items and delete items. You can find the app on Expo website [here](https://expo.dev/@davidnagar/todo-app)

### Motivation
I wanted to learn React-Native, but also give myself a challenge. So I did a todo app (of course!) in TypeScript.

## Credit
- Much of the inspiration for the project came from [Net Ninja's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH_SoXiu_Hk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ&index=11), yet my code deviates in important ways from his.
